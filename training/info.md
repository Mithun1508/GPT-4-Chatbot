# GPT-4 is OpenAI’s most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses

## GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem solving abilities.

### Creativity
GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style.

### Visual Input
GPT-4 can accept images as inputs and generate captions, classifications, and analyses.

### Longer Context
GPT-4 is capable of handling over 25,000 words of text, allowing for use cases like long form content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis.

## GPT-4 surpasses ChatGPT in its advanced reasoning capabilities.

| **Input**: Andrew is free from 11 am to 3 pm, Joanne is free from noon to 2 pm and then 3:30 pm to 5 pm. Hannah is available at noon for half an hour, and then 4 pm to 6 pm. What are some options for start times for a 30 minute meeting for Andrew, Hannah, and Joanne? | **Input**: Andrew is free from 11 am to 3 pm, Joanne is free from noon to 2 pm and then 3:30 pm to 5 pm. Hannah is available at noon for half an hour, and then 4 pm to 6 pm. What are some options for start times for a 30 minute meeting for Andrew, Hannah, and Joanne? |
| **Output**: Here is a list of their availability:
- Andrew: 11 am to 3 pm
- Joanne: noon to 2 pm, and 3:30 pm to 5 pm
- Hannah: noon to 12:30 pm, and 4 pm to 6 pm

Based on their availability, there is a 30-minute window where all three of them are available, which is from 4 pm to 4:30 pm. So, the meeting can be scheduled at 4 pm. | **Output**: Andrew: 11 am - 3 pm
Joanne: 12 pm - 2 pm, 3:30 pm - 5 pm
Hannah: 12 pm - 12:30 pm, 4 pm - 6 pm

Common availability for a 30-minute meeting: 12 pm - 12:30 pm

## GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT by scoring in higher approximate percentiles among test-takers.

## Following the research path from GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, our deep learning approach leverages more data and more computation to create increasingly sophisticated and capable language models.

### We spent 6 months making GPT-4 safer and more aligned. GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations.

## Safety & alignment
### Training with human feedback
We incorporated more human feedback, including feedback submitted by ChatGPT users, to improve GPT-4’s behavior. We also worked with over 50 experts for early feedback in domains including AI safety and security.

### Continuous improvement from real-world use
We’ve applied lessons from real-world use of our previous models into GPT-4’s safety research and monitoring system. Like ChatGPT, we’ll be updating and improving GPT-4 at a regular cadence as more people use it.

### GPT-4-assisted safety research
GPT-4’s advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities expedited our safety work. We used GPT-4 to help create training data for model fine-tuning and iterate on classifiers across training, evaluations, and monitoring.

## Built with GPT-4
### We’ve collaborated with organizations building innovative products with GPT-4

## Research

GPT-4 is the latest milestone in OpenAI’s effort in scaling up deep learning.

## Infrastructure
GPT-4 was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers. Azure’s AI-optimized infrastructure also allows us to deliver GPT-4 to users around the world.


## Limitations
GPT-4 still has many known limitations that we are working to address, such as social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts. We encourage and facilitate transparency, user education, and wider AI literacy as society adopts these models. We also aim to expand the avenues of input people have in shaping our models.

## Availability
GPT-4 is available on ChatGPT Plus and as an API for developers to build applications and services.
